## To Do List

- Reorg folders
- Convert to React Hooks
- Add unit tests
- Try typescript
- Other refactoring improvements



## Issues
- column widths on search results changes depending on search terms (compare hello to harry potter to hi) because search bar text inside is long (truncate string length?)
- when you click logo to go to home, should clear search result in box
